# Thinking in React
  ## Draw Mock
   1. Draw Boxes around each component/subcomponent.
   2. Decide which parts should be a component, base this off of the single responsiblity principle: each component should handle one task. 

  ## Build Static site
   1. Build a version of the UI that shows the data, but with no interactivity
   2. Ensure that you are building appropriate components, that pass props and use state. 


  ## Represent State
   1. Find the minimum set of state that your app will need to function. 
   2. Identify which components state should live in.
