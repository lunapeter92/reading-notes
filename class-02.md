## CSS
  -CSS allows you to style your webpage, and control the design. 
  
  -CSS allows you to modify how the HTML looks by associating style with elements
    -example syntax: 
        `h1 {background-color: red;}`
        -h1 is the selector
        -background color is the property
        -red is the value
    -can also associate with classes, id's, type and children/sibling selectors. 
        
   ### Linking CSS
   -There are two ways to link CSS into your HTML
    - You can include an internal style using the `<style>` tag. 
    -Youc an include an external document using the `<link>` tag.
