# Class 4 Notes

## CSS Layout
  ## Positioning Elements
   - CSS allows you to use different positioning's in order to control the layout of webpages. These positions include: 
    - Normal Flow
      - For block level elements, they will appear on a new line. No elements will appear side by side. 
    - Relative Positioning
      - Moves an element to either right,left,top, or bottom of where it normally is. This doesn't affect other elements positioning. 
    - Absolute Positioning
      - Absolute positioning allows you to 'stick' an element to the page and it remains in that specific position while the page moves. i.e. header will stay on top of page as user scrolls up and down. 
    - Fixed Positioning
      - Form of absolute positioning that 'sticks' an element to a specific place in the DOM, but doesn't will stay in that place while user scrolls up and down. 
    - Floating Elements
      - Allows you to take the element and stick it to the left and right of it's parent container. This causes the element to become a block level element where the rest of the content flows around it. 
      
  - z-index: This property allows you to control which elements will 'float' on top of others when there is an issue with overlapping. 
       `z-index: 10;`
