## Functional Programming: 
  - According to the article, functional programming is a style of building the structure and elements of computer programs. It treats computation as evaluation of math functions.
   It avoids changing state and mutable data. 
   
   Pure Functions: 
    - We know a function is a pure function if it: 
        1. returns same results given in arguments
        2. Has no side effects
    - Pros of Pure Functions: 
        1. Easy to test, you already know what the result will be. 
        
   Immutability: 
    - Immutability is the idea that a value, or piece of data will NOT change over time and cannot be changed.
