# Class 8 Notes
Notes taken from John Duckets HTML/CSS

## CSS Layout
  - Screen Sizes/Screen Resolution
    - Users who visit your site's screen size/resolution will vary depending on what device they are visiting your site from. 
     - These could range from Iphones to computer monitors. 
    - Most designers try to create pages that are around 960-1000px wide. 

  ### Fixed Width Layouts
   - With Fixed Width designs, the web pages do not change size when a user changes the size of their screens. 
    - Measurements tend to be in Pixels 
   
  ### Liquid Layouts
   - Liquid layout designs WILL change sizes depending on what screen size the user has. 
    - Measurements tend to be in percentages.
