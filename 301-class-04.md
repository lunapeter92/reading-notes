# React Forms
Notes Taken From https://reactjs.org/docs/forms.html

##Controlled Component
  - A controlled component is a component that combines elements that combine their own state, as well as using setState functionality and controls them, such as in form elements. 
  - A React component that renders a form in this way, by controlling what happens in that form, is a controlled component. 

## Storing User Inputs
  -The value attribute is set on a form element, and will always be this.state.value
  - As soon as a user logs a keystroke within a form, the state will be updated with the value.
