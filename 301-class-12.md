## SQL VS NoSQL
 - SQL databases are called relational databases, NoSql are called non-relational
 - SQL db's are table based databases, where NoSQL are document based. 
 - SQL has predetermined schemas, and nosql has a dynamic structure
 - SQL is horizontally scaled and nosql are horizontally. 
    - sql is scaled to increase power of hardware, where nosql is scaled to increase pool resources, which reduces the load. 

 - SQL is good for complex query intensive environments, where nosql are not. 
 - SQL can be scaled by adding more hardware, where as nosql can be scaled by increasing the amount of servers available.
