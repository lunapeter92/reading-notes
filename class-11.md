Notes taken from John Duckets HTML/CSS

## Images
  
  ### Controlling Size of Images
   - The size of Images can be controlled with both the height and width properties
   - Setting the size of images can help the webpage load smoothly. It allows the browser to know how much space to leave for the image while loading page. 
  
  ### Aligning Images
   - The float property allows you to control the side it's containing block it's on so you can allow text to flow around it. 
   - By default images are inline elements, if you need to center the image you have to turn it into a block level element. 
    - To Center: 
      1. use text-align property to center
      2. set margin property to auto. 
   
  ### Background Images
   - background-image property allows you to specify an image to be used in the background. 
   - By default a background image will repeat to fill box.
