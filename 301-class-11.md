## OAuth
- OAuth is an open source Authentication tool that allows users to authenicate and access resources without sharing their logon information. 
    - This authentication looks like going to a website, and when you attempt to signin, instead of creating an account on that site, you sign in with your google account. 
- How it works: 
    - OAuth connects to the website that is used for authentication, (i.e. Google). 
    - The website that was used for authentication then creates a token, and redirects the user back to the original site. 
    - The original site can then utilize that token to allow the user to login.
