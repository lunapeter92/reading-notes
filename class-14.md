## Building the perfect team

   This article focuses on how teams can be created that are not only able to work together to effectively build products, but also how the teammates can come together to build friendships that 
  allow them the freedom to offer ideas that they wouldn't feel comfortable offering with people they aren't close with. One example that they give is a woman named Julia who was trying to find 
  a career that she was interested in, as well as work in a team she felt she could bond with. She decided to enroll herself in business school where the main focus of their work was to collaborate 
  with other students to complete assignments. Unforunately, her first team wasn't able to find the bond they needed to effectively work together, but the second team she found, though they can from
  different walks of life, was able to become close and ultimately find success. 
  
   Something interesting that I gathered from this article was their example of Google using data and research to find how to effectively build teams and analyze how their employees actions create these teams. 
   One example was they noticed that employees who were most productive, also happened to build their network by branching out with who they ate lunch with everyday. They also found that good managers are ones 
   who don't micromanage and who are able to communicate with their team. Something about this that really stuck with me was how even Google learned that if a manager micromanages, and doesn't effectively communicate
   their work and employees suffer.
