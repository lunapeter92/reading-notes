# Class One Notes
  *Notes taken from John Duckets HTML/CSS & Javascript/Jquery

## Structure 
  -HTML uses elements to structure web pages
    - These elements include tags and attributes to tell what the elements purpose is, as well as any additional information the browser needs to know. 
    
  -HTML has been introducing new ways to layout the webpage. This new way can help with website searchability, as well as helping those who use special tools to access webpages. 
    Syntax: 
      -`<header></header>` / `<footer></footer>` / `<nav></nav> `, some accessibility tools can help users skip these sections.
      -`<article></article>`, due to these tags being located in the body of the web page, search engines like Google will focus on these parts for search reasons. 
      
##Javascript
  - Using Javascript in web pages allows developers to modify and add specific parts of the DOM using scripts.
    - Can use JS for focusing on events in the browser, as well as for changing styling
    - Javascript is an object oriented programming language.
  -Javascript scripts are mainly a series of instructions that are followed programmatically. 
  
  ### Linking Scripts in HTML
    - There are a few ways to link scripts in HTML: 
        - First, is including a `<script> console.log('test'); </script> ` tag with the javascript put directly in the HTML document. 
        -Second, is creating a separate file that is linked in the HTML document using the `<script src="app.js"></script>`
