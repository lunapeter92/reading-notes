## Javascript call stack
  - Call Stack: 
    - The call stack is a data structure for explaining the 'function heirarchy and the execurtion order' when the code is run.
    - Based on the LIFO principle, (last in, first out). 
  -Stack Overflow: 
    - Stack overflow is created when there is a function that has no way of stopping/exiting. 
    -There is a point where the browser will reach the maximum amount of memory allowed and will throw an error for the overflow.
