## Lists and Keys
  Rendering Multiple Components: 
    - You can loop through an array of items using the map function and then return a list of elements for each item. These elements can be components, or a simple list of 
      items from an array. 
  
  Key Items: 
    - A key is a special string attribute that needs to be included when creating lists of elements, used when passing items as props to components. 
    - Keys help React identify which items have changed within the lists given. 
    - It's important to use unique keys, such as the index of an array item (this option could negatively affect performance.)
    
    
    
 ## Spread Operator
  -Used in adding to arrays, combining arrays/objects and spreading array into function arguments
  
  -Spread syntax uses ... to expand iterable object into list of arguments
    - i.e. (...arr)
    `Math.max(...[1,3,5}])`
